# CAN YOU HELP ME ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
## Category: Forensics

### Description

I need your assistance with something urgent. It seems like my system got hacked, and I suspect someone has been sneaking around, stealing my stuff. I'm not a tech whiz, but I did manage to capture some network traffic using Wireshark. The problem is, I have no clue what to do with all this data. Can you help me figure out what they were after and how they pulled it off?

By the way, on a lighter note, are you into PUBG matches? I'd love to play, but my internet's been acting up lately. My 'ping' is through the roof, making it impossible to enjoy the game.
